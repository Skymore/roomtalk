## üîß Technical Challenges

### WebSocket Reliability on Mobile Devices

One of the most significant challenges we faced was maintaining reliable WebSocket connections on mobile devices, particularly when apps transition between foreground and background states.

#### Problem
- When a mobile app moves to the background, browsers may suspend WebSocket connections
- Even when connections appear active, event listeners often become unresponsive
- Users can send messages (via HTTP fallback) but not receive them without refreshing
- Different browsers and mobile platforms handle background connections inconsistently

#### Our Solution
We implemented a multi-layered approach to ensure connection reliability:

1. **Enhanced Socket.io Configuration**
   - Configured automatic reconnection with optimized timeouts and delays
   - Implemented connection state tracking to detect "zombie" connections
   - Added transport fallback mechanisms (WebSocket ‚Üí HTTP polling)

2. **Event Listener Management**
   - Created a system to detect and rebind event listeners when they become unresponsive
   - Implemented event reference tracking to prevent duplicate event bindings
   - Added message deduplication to prevent repeated messages after reconnection

3. **Visibility-Based Recovery**
   - Utilized the Page Visibility API to detect when apps return to the foreground
   - Implemented connection health checks when visibility changes
   - Automatically refresh message data when returning from background state

4. **Active Room Tracking**
   - Maintained client-side records of active room participation
   - Automatically rejoined rooms after connection reestablishment
   - Implemented server-side session recovery mechanisms

This comprehensive approach ensures message delivery reliability across different devices and network conditions, maintaining a seamless user experience even in challenging mobile environments.

## üì¶ Redis Persistence

The system supports two Redis deployment options:

### Local Development
Uses standard Redis with **RDB snapshot** persistence by default. You may enable **AOF** or adjust save policies via `redis.conf`.

### Production (Upstash Redis)
For production environments, we recommend using Upstash Redis, which offers:

- **Instant Persistence**: Data is immediately saved to block storage alongside memory, making it reliable as a primary database
- **Multi-Region Replication**: Automatic data replication across regions for better availability
- **Serverless Architecture**: No Redis instance management needed, scales automatically
- **REST API Access**: Supports both Redis protocol and HTTP/REST API access

Configuration example:
```env
REDIS_URL=your-upstash-redis-url
REDIS_TOKEN=your-upstash-token
```
